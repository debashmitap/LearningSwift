 Assignment 4: Dictionary in memory
 
 For this assignment, we will re-implement a basic version of Dictionary.
 Our dictionary will be keyed by `String`s and contain `Int`s,
 and its capacity is fixed upon initialization.
 
 This is a sample use of our dictionary:
 
 ```
 var dict = MyDictionary(size: 10)
 dict["A"] = 2
 dict["A"] // should contain 2
 ```
 
 -------
 
 Here's how this dictionary should work.
 
 A dictionary is formed by buckets.
 Each bucket has three pieces of information:
 - a bit that determines whether or not that bucket is valid;
 - a key that is used to find the bucket;
 - and a value that is stored in the bucket.
 
 These are represented by three arrays: `bitMap`, `keys` and `values`.
 In memory, these arrays are placed sequentially, like this:
 
 bitMap      keys     values
 游릱游릱游릱游릱游릱游릲游릲游릲游릲游릲游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴
 
 Each item in `bitMap` is a single bit;
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
 the sizes of `keys` and `values` depends on the type we want.
=======
    the sizes of `keys` and `values` depend on the types we want.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
 In this case, the size of our dictionary is something like this:
 
 (sizeOf(Bool) + sizeOf(String) + sizeOf(Int)) * capacity
 
 For easier visualization, think of each bucket as a vertical stack
 of bit, key and value, like this:
 
 b0 b1 b2 b3 b4
 bitMap:    游릱 游릱 游릱 游릱 游릱
 keys:      游릲 游릲 游릲 游릲 游릲
 values:    游릴 游릴 游릴 游릴 游릴
 
 -------
 
 There are two main operations we can perform on our dictionary: read and write.
 
 The first is to read a value from it.
 When a key is supplied to the dictionary, it must return the corresponding value.
 
 To do this, the dictionary should calculate the hash of the key;
 this is a number that uniquely represents a value.
 Then, this hash needs to be squeezed into a value within the
 bounds of the capacity of the dictionary.
 The dictionary then looks for the bucket whose key matches the given one,
 starting its search by the position determined by the squeezed hash.
 If a matching bucket is found, its value is returned; if none is found,
 the dictionary returns nil.
 
 
 The second operation is to write a value.
 The value should be stored in the bucket that corresponds to a given key.
 
 Just like in read, we need the squeezed hash of the given key.
 The dictionary then looks for an empty bucket, starting its search
 by the position determined by the squeezed hash.
 Once an empty bucket is found, it marks the bit as true, then stores
 the key and the value.
 
 -------
 
 Assignment: You must implement the empty methods of the struct below,
 in order to have a dictionary that works as described above.
 
 Tip: Start by implementing the easier methods, `squeeze` and `next`.
 Then, implement `find` and `findHole`, which use the `next` method.
 Finally, implement the `get` and the `set`, using the methods you implemented before.
