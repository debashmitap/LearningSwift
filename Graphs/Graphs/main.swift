 Assignment 6: Out of the playground
 
 From now on, we'll move from the Playground to an actual project.
 Use the project navigator to your left to find the files.
 
 For now, we only have three:
    - `main.swift`, this file;
    - `Graph.swift`, containing our Graph data structure; and
    - `GraphsTests.swift`, which contains our unit tests.
 
 This file, main.swift, contains the code that will be run upon execution.
 To run the project, click the Play button on the top bar, or press Cmd+R.
 The output will be in the bottom view.
 Try doing it now.
 
 For now, we won't use this file a lot. Most of your code will go into
    Graph.swift, and we'll test it using the unit tests.
 To test your project, click and hold the play button, then choose Test;
    or press Cmd+U.
 The tests results will be in the test navigator tab (Cmd+6).
 Try doing it now.
 
 Take a look at the unit tests and understand what they do.
 Some of them pass, others fail. Why?
 
 On this assignment, you must identify the failing tests, and then
 implement or correct the necessary code.
